**Aspects we're proud of:**
Our team exceeded expectations in regard to overcoming challenges. Many of the individuals on this project had not worked in a team environment using GitHub before. Most were new to coding, some had just the basic skills of HTML and CSS and quite a few were rusty (or had never programmed before) in the React.js language. There was no lack of enthusiasm for giving it a try. 

We were all encouraged to see a project come together so elegantly especially considering the short time frame we had to complete the project and that this was a group of people who had never worked together before. In fact, most of us had never met before the formation of the team. Tina Flower proved to be an outstanding and compassionate leader whose clear and concise direction kept us on task and motivated. She was kind in her reminders and always ready and willing to provide any assistance to see the project forward. 

This project took many of us outside of our comfort zones. There were moments when we were genuinely perplexed. The end result is that we learned something new, made connections both in and outside of this project, and accomplished something we all are proud of. 

**Lessons Learned:**
It can be easy to get carried away in a thought or an idea. Having a strong leader who can keep a team focused is essential when time is of the essence. 

It is not a requirement to know everything about programming to start or join a project. Start where you are.
